# Blue Nebula Policy Documents

No project can really survive in the long term without rules. We try to be as transparent and open about our rules, and define them together, as a community.

We have split our guidelines into multiple documents for different audiences. These are introduced in the following sections.

**Please note that these guidelines are not effective as of yet. They should be considered drafts. We'll present them to our community on our [forum](https://go.blue-nebula.org/forum). Once we have a consensus, we'll remove this note. Please feel free to contribute in the process.**


## Community Guidelines

The [Community Guidelines](contribution-guidelines.md) contain rules and recommendations the Blue Nebula community commits itself to. As a community, we strive for a healthy, open and welcoming atmosphere, which is fun for everyone.

We strive for transparency in our moderative activities. The guidelines clearly show which parts are considered rules and enforced by the moderators, and which ones are considered recommendations.

All guidelines are written in the interest of all sides involved: players, moderators, developers, and everyone else participating in this game. We believe it's best to be transparent about existing rules, and are open for discussing them with our community. Self-reflection is important, and we welcome any constructive feedback. Please do not hesitate to get in touch!


## Contribution Guidelines

The [Contribution Guidelines](contribution-guidelines.md) outline rules and recommendations regarding the development of Blue Nebula.

The contribution guidelines are only relevant for developers and other people who intend to work on the official game, for instance by adding new content or sending pull requests for the game's source code. Players don't need to read them unless they want to help improve the game for everyone!


## Regular review and improvement

Guidelines and rules are never fully static. When a community grows and develops, its needs change. Our guidelines shall develop with the community. To accomplish this goal, we want to review and improve our guidelines in a recurring process, together with our community. We don't have a complete concept yet. Input is very welcome! Please refer to our [forum](https://go.blue-nebula.org/forum) for more information.
